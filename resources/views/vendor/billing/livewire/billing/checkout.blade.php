    App will override of devdojo/billing's checkout view.

    The packaged view depends on Filament Blade components (<x-filament::modal>),
    which is not installed. This app ships its own pricing experience at
    /pricing (resources/views/livewire/pricing.blade.php), so this override is a
    lightweight, Filament-free stand-in that keeps `view:cache` / `optimize`
    working and points anyone landing here to the real pricing page.
